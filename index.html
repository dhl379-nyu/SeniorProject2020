        <p>I was born in 1997 in the countryside of Korea. I was raised at my grandmother’s home because my parents could not afford to rent their own place. However, this was a common story for everyone.</p>
        <p>In 1997, the Korean economy collapsed and countless people lost jobs as companies declared bankruptcy. The government was unable to control the damage and turned to the IMF for financial aids. Hence, it was coined as the “IMF Crisis” in
          Korea. Lives and dreams were destroyed. In 1998, a year after the initial shock, the suicide rate skyrocketed by 42% compared to the previous year. My father was studying abroad in Queens, NY. The money he was receiving from Korea was
          worthless as the exchange rate plummeted. He immediately headed to the local laundromat for a job. My mother relied on tutoring English at home.</p>
        <p>When my father returned from America, he found a job at an insurance company. He always left to work before I would wake up, and return home when I was asleep. After several years, we moved to Seoul. Within the town we lived in, we moved
          almost annually. At the time, I did not realize that we were moving because the landlord raised rent, which we could not afford to pay. </p>

    </div>
    <div class="textBox2">
      <p>In 2005, I was given a 2-week notice from my parents that we were going to Canada. At the time, I did not even realize that Canada was a country. I was informed so casually that I assumed that it must be some new restaurant around the block.
        The reality did not hit me until my very last day in Korea. My classmates wrote letters for me and collected them in a box as a good-bye gift. Even as I looked outside the airplane’s window, everything felt so surreal.</p>
      <p>I arrived in Canada without even memorizing the entire alphabet let alone know how to introduce myself. As a result, I spent my first year in school as a mute only being able to communicate through other Korean international students.</p>

      <p>In 2008, the Global Financial Crisis hit and every news channel talked about the economy collapsing. It also talked about major banks in Wall Street going bankrupt and the term subprime mortgage was thrown around. The media made it seem like
        the
        world was ending. I was too young to fully comprehend the situation, but there was one thing I completely understood: fear.</p>
      <p>My parents listened to the news daily and I tried my best to ignore the doomsday talk. However, the impact of the situation became tangible when it started to affect my friends. As my English was still subpar, most of the friends I made were
        other international Korean students. A lot of the friends I made disappeared one by one as their family could not endure the financial burden of living in Canada. I began to think about the stories my dad told me during the IMF Crisis in
        Korea and wondered if my current living situation would come to an end.</p>

    </div>
    <div class="section3Img">

    </div>
    <div class="textBox3">
      <p>In 2015, I got accepted to NYU Paris. I could not believe that I would be able to study abroad in Paris as a freshman. My family booked a trip to Europe and we visited the UK, Germany, Italy, and France. At the end of the trip, it felt very
        bizarre as I felt like I should be heading back home with my family. Instead, I was dropped off at my dorm in Paris.</p>
      <p>My rose-tinted view of Paris was quickly shattered. Racism was more prevalent in Paris than in Canada. I was mugged and scammed more times than I could count. Visiting Paris as a tourist and living in it were two vastly different things.</p>
      <p>But one night, in particular, stood out from the rest. On November 13th, I woke up late in the afternoon in my room. As I tried to grab a baguette from the local bakery, I was immediately stopped by two RAs who were guarding the door. Upon
        my protest, one of them took me to their room and turned on the TV.</p>
      <p>Shattered glass. Flashing lights. Blood. Terror attacks. It took me a second to fully process what was being shown on the TV. When I looked at my phone, I realized that there were numerous calls and texts from friends and family. I searched
        the locations
        of the shooting and realized that most of them were only a 20-minute drive away from the dorm. The RAs were busy on the phone trying to reach a couple of students who were at the football match where an explosion was reported.</p>
      <p>The class resumed as usual. The air in the city felt different. In fact, most of the city seemed eerily silent. My very first class after the incident was a French course. When I entered the class, our professor – who was born and raised in
        Paris – looked at the ground silently. I could not imagine what was going through her head.</p>

    </div>
    <div class="textBox4">
      <p>In 2016, I returned to NYU at the main campus in New York. After a tumultuous introduction to college, I was determined to make the most out of my remaining years. I decided to change my major from Liberal Studies to Integrated Digital
        Media, which is at the Brooklyn campus. Life remained unstable as my best friend dropped out of college due to issues at home.</p>
      <p>Despite a couple of hiccups, I managed to persevere. I successfully transitioned into my new major, and graduation was on the edge of my fingertips. It felt like I could finally settle down once I graduate and find a job in New York. Until
        that happened: COVID-19.</p>

    <div class="textBox4">
      <p>Every day I was bombarded with emails regarding COVID-19, and the emails progressively got more pessimistic. On March 16th, the school finally pulled the trigger. All student residence halls were closed and we were given a 48-hour notice to
        leave. My goal of working in New York or even graduating for that matter became unclear. Some news articles claimed that the economic damage from COVID-19 will exceed the damages during the 2008 Global Financial Crisis. It reminded me of how
        college graduates struggled during 2008, and now it was my turn. But now I am not afraid. My life was always in a crisis and life moves on.</p>
